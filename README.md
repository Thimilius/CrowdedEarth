# IDEAS
- Show population data (history) of metropolitan areas as pillars
- Show population data (history) of countries as pillars
- Let the area be picked -> Can be focused and be more detailed
- Add more details on zoom into area

# TODO
- Try static data from https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REGION_DEMOGR#
- Make it look nicer
